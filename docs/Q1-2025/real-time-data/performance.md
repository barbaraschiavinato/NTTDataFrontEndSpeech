# Performance Best Practices


## 1. **Debounce/Throttle Messages**
   - WebSockets can send messages continuously, which can overload the app, especially if you're dealing with large amounts of real-time data. To prevent performance degradation:
     - **Debounce**: Limit the number of updates by delaying the execution of the function for a specified time.
     - **Throttle**: Restrict the number of executions over time, ensuring that messages are processed at a consistent rate.

```ts
import React, { useState, useEffect, useRef } from 'react';

const Example = () => {
  const [messages, setMessages] = useState<string[]>([]);
  const debounceTimeout = useRef<NodeJS.Timeout | null>(null);
  const lastThrottledTime = useRef<number>(0);
  const socketRef = useRef<WebSocket | null>(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    const socket = new WebSocket('ws://example.com/socket');

    socket.onopen = () => {
      console.log('WebSocket connected');
    };

    socket.onmessage = (event) => {
      const message = event.data;

      if (debounceTimeout.current) {
        clearTimeout(debounceTimeout.current);
      }
      debounceTimeout.current = setTimeout(() => {
        setMessages((prevMessages) => [...prevMessages, `Debounced: ${message}`]);
      }, 500);

      // Throttle logic
      const now = Date.now();
      if (now - lastThrottledTime.current >= 1000) {
        lastThrottledTime.current = now;
        setMessages((prevMessages) => [...prevMessages, `Throttled: ${message}`]);
      }
    };

    socketRef.current = socket;

    return () => {
      if (socketRef.current) {
        socketRef.current.close();
      }
    };
  }, []);

  return (
    <div>
      <h3>Messages:</h3>
      <ul>
        {messages.map((msg, idx) => (
          <li key={idx}>{msg}</li>
        ))}
      </ul>
    </div>
  );
};

export default WebSocketDebounceThrottleExample;


```
## 2. **Keep WebSocket Connections Efficient**
   - **Reconnection Logic**: Implement automatic reconnects for when the WebSocket connection drops. Using libraries like `reconnecting-websocket` can help handle reconnections and backoff strategies.
   - **Ping/Pong Mechanism**: To prevent timeouts and keep the connection alive, periodically send ping messages from the client, and handle pong responses from the server.

## 3. **Optimize State Management**
   - React’s state should be optimized to prevent unnecessary re-renders. Avoid updating the state for every single WebSocket message unless it is absolutely necessary. Use techniques like:
     - **React's `useState` and `useReducer`**: For managing and updating the state more efficiently.
     - **Memoization**: Use `React.memo()` or `useMemo()` to prevent unnecessary re-renders of components that don’t depend on the WebSocket data.
     - **Throttling State Updates**: Avoid updating the state too frequently by batching updates or using throttling techniques.

## 4. **Efficient Data Handling**
   - **Data Transformation**: If the WebSocket server is sending large objects, avoid unnecessary transformations on the client-side. Perform data transformations only when needed.
   - **Data Compression**: Consider using compression (like `gzip` or `Brotli`) for the messages sent over WebSocket, especially if the data size is large.

## 5. **Use WebSocket Subprotocols**
   - WebSocket supports subprotocols that allow you to define custom protocols for your communication. This can be used to optimize data formats and ensure that only necessary data is transmitted.
   
## 6. **Avoid Memory Leaks**
   - Properly clean up WebSocket connections when components unmount or no longer need them:
     - Use `useEffect` to initialize and clean up WebSocket connections.
     - Close WebSocket connections in the `cleanup` function of `useEffect` to prevent memory leaks.

     Example:
     ```jsx
     useEffect(() => {
       const socket = new WebSocket('ws://your-websocket-url');
       
       socket.onmessage = (event) => {
         // Handle message
       };
       
       return () => {
         socket.close(); // Cleanup
       };
     }, []);
     ```

## 7. **Batch Updates to the UI**
   - For frequent real-time updates, batch updates together to avoid triggering too many re-renders. For instance, if WebSocket messages are related, you can batch them and update the state in a single call, reducing the number of re-renders.

## 8. **Use Libraries for WebSocket Management**
   - Consider using libraries like:
     - **`socket.io`**: For automatic reconnection, message buffering, and other advanced features.
     - **`reconnecting-websocket`**: For managing WebSocket connections with reconnection logic.
     - **`use-websocket`**: A React hook library for managing WebSocket connections and automatic clean-up.

## 9. **Limit WebSocket Data Volume**
   - If the WebSocket sends too much data, limit the frequency of messages and size of the payloads:
     - **On the server side**, limit the frequency of broadcasts.
     - **On the client side**, consider processing only the most relevant messages or applying filters.

## 10. **Avoid Blocking the UI Thread**
   - Keep the WebSocket-related code non-blocking. Avoid any heavy computation on the main thread. You can use `setTimeout`, `requestIdleCallback`, or workers to offload heavy tasks, ensuring the UI remains responsive.

## 11. **Error Handling and Monitoring**
   - Implement error handling for WebSocket failures and dropped connections. It's important to gracefully handle such errors to ensure a smooth user experience.
   - Use `try/catch` for error management and implement logging to monitor WebSocket performance.

## 12. **Use Web Workers for Intensive Tasks**
   - If you're doing resource-heavy processing based on WebSocket messages, consider offloading such tasks to Web Workers to avoid blocking the UI.
